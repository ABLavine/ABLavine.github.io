                <div class="project-h4">I made a text editor for a school project in Java. It looks pretty nice, and can run code from the intigrated terminal in the editor window. It can also do everything with git you would expect an IDE to do, push, pull, commit, etc.</div>

                <div class="project-h4">During my math class in my freshman year, I got bored w/ the manual labor of doing the same formula over and over again. So, I made a calculator that took the givens and the unknown for any given trig problem, and solved it. Showed my "work" too. When I had a similar problem w/ physics, I did the same thing, then merged the two calculators. I was unable to get proper img processing to work, sadly.  </div>
