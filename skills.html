I think all it did was randomly mess up their keystrokes, or something along those lines. I wanted to use C# because it was similar to Java (or so I've heard) and I needed the .NET framework to make it easier to make an executable to run on other machines. I also had to learn C# to use the Unity Game engine, which I very much enjoyed.</p>
